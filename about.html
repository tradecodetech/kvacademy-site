    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        KV Academy is a community-based educational initiative focused on preparing
        youth for life beyond the classroom. We provide hands-on learning experiences
        that develop practical skills, leadership ability, and confidence.

        Our programs are designed to meet students where they are — helping them
        grow through responsibility, mentorship, and exposure to real-world challenges.

<!-- APPROACH -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
        KV Academy uses a hands-on, project-based approach to learning.
        Students build skills by doing — working with real tools, solving
        real problems, and taking on real responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        We integrate structured mentoring, academic support, digital creativity,
        and leadership development into every program. This approach helps students
        develop both technical skills and the character traits needed for long-term success.
    </p>
