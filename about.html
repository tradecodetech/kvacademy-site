        <h1>Building Leaders. Shaping Futures.</h1>

     ORIGIN STORY
=========================== -->
<section class="section fade-in">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>
        KV Academy began with a simple mission: to create a space where young people could grow through 
        **discipline, skill-building, entrepreneurship, and real-world responsibility**.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:15px;">
        What started as community mentorship evolved into a structured youth academy — combining
        financial literacy, trading education, entrepreneurship (like lawn care and service projects),
        and real-life character development.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:15px;">
        KV Academy's foundation is built on **purpose**, **confidence**, and **leadership** — giving young 
        men and women a fighting chance to succeed in a world that demands creativity, resilience, and integrity.
